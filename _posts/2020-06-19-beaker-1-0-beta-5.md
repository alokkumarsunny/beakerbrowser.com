New Beaker release! With 1.0 Beta 5, we added "Minimizing" to tabs, expanded on the folder-sync tools, improved `query()` output, and more.

## Minimizing tabs

[As we discussed in our roadmap](/2020/06/10/roadmap-summer-2020.html), a very common need with peer-to-peer computing is to run Web apps in the background. This makes it convenient to run indexers and network-services.

Rather than create a complex "background scripts" model, we decided to make it possible to minimize tabs to a background tray. A minimized tab will continue to run as before and will be restored after quitting and restarting Beaker.

Minimized tabs are very useful for your long-running processes, but they're also nice for "putting away" tabs that you want to read later.

## Folder sync, part deux

<img src="/img/posts/beaker-1-0-beta-5/folder-sync.png">

[In 1.0 Beta 4](/2020/06/04/beaker-1-0-beta-4.html), we introduced a tool to sync Hyperdrives with folders on your device. We got some quick feedback and decided to make some tweaks. Folder sync now uses a modal with tools to explore the changes, a "restore back to folder" button, and a `.gitignore` style ruleset for choosing which files to skip.

You should find folder sync much easier to work with now! [Read more about it here](https://docs.beakerbrowser.com/intermediate/syncing-with-folders).


## Better `query()` output

The [hyperdrive `query()`](https://docs.beakerbrowser.com/apis/beaker.hyperdrive#beakerhyperdrivequeryquery) function is a powerful tool for reading data in the Hyper network. It's like a `SELECT` for files.

With this release, we added an `origin` object to the results which gives detailed information about a file's owning drive. This is especially useful when dealing with mounts.

For example, imagine a folder structure which looks like this:

```
hyper://foo/
hyper://foo/mount-folder -> hyper://bar/
hyper://foo/mount-folder/index.html
```

The file `hyper://foo/mount-folder/index.html` is originally from `hyper://bar/index.html`. The query results will now help you discover this:

```javascript
await beaker.hyperdrive.query({
  drive: 'hyper://foo/',
  path: '/mount-folder/*'
})
```

Result:

```javascript
[{
  drive: 'hyper://foo/',
  path: '/mount-folder/index.html',
  url: 'hyper://foo/mount-folder/index.html',
  origin: {
    drive: 'hyper://bar/',
    path: '/index.html',
    url: 'hyper://bar/index.html',
  },
  // ...
}]
```
