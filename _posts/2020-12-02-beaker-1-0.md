The experimental browser is finally 1.0!

Beaker hosts websites _from your device_ using [peer-to-peer technology](https://hypercore-protocol.org). It is a great tool for webdev without touching the command-line or setting up a server.

Use-cases include:

 - **Educators**. A Web dev classroom can skip teaching the command-line, git, or server setup. Students create their sites in-browser (or copy a template from the teacher) and do their development with the builtin tools.
 - **Dev Teams**. If you're looking for a fast way to share site prototypes in the office, Beaker is a great fit. You can quickly fork a site to make changes, then share the new URL with the team.
 - **Decentralizers**. We may not have an out-of-the-box replacement for the big platforms _yet_, but if you're the kind of person that's into blockchains or greater access to open-source, you should check this out.

Beaker uses a replacement for HTTP called the [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org) which has its own `hyper://` URL. That means you can't load the sites on any browser (which is why Beaker still earns its title as an "experimental" browser). That makes Beaker a bit niche for now, but we're pretty excited to expand that niche moving forward.

## Hypercore Protocol

The [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org) (formerly the "Dat protocol") works a bit like BitTorrent: visitors to a site will download its files and rehost them to share bandwidth. Unlike BitTorrent, Hypercore is able to change the files without creating a new URL! It's also quite good at [other kinds of data than files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hyperbee), though Beaker hasn't tapped into that yet.

If you're interested in building on the Hypercore Protocol, check out the [Hyperspace Daemon](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/hyperspace). It provides a batteries-included toolset for peer-to-peer files and databases.

## A Tour: Creating P2P Sites

Beaker's peer-to-peer sites are called "Hyperdrives." You can create them from the browser menu.

You can start from scratch, sync a local folder, or clone a git repo.

<img class="bordered" src="/img/posts/beaker-1-0/new-hyperdrive-prompt.png" title="New Hyperdrive Prompt">

From here, Beaker will open the new site with the editor open and ready for you to build.

Once your site is ready, you can share the `hyper://` URL with people and they'll connect to your computer to see the site. You can see the peer-count in the URL bar:

Here's a (slightly sped-up) video of the total experience:

[We have lots of documentation](https://docs.beakerbrowser.com) if you want to get more familiar with the tools.

## P2P Site Templates / Demos

If you want to get your hands on some example code, check out a couple of these pre-made templates which you can easily create in Beaker:

<div class="site-templates">
  <a href="https://beaker.dev/docs/templates/photo-album/" title="Photo Album Site" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://beaker.dev/templates/photo-album.png">
    <span>Photo Album Site</span>
  </a>
  <a href="https://beaker.dev/docs/templates/microblog-feed/" title="Microblog Feed App" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://beaker.dev/templates/microblog-feed.png">
    <span>Microblog Feed App</span>

## What's next?

Based on everything we've learned building Beaker, we're starting our new tool for the Hypercore Protocol called **Uplink**. If you're curious to find out what it is and what we're doing, [we're launching a Patreon for this new project](https://patreon.com/paul_maf_and_andrew) where we'll share project updates and early access to builds.

So, from here:

 - [Download Beaker Browser 1.0](/install/),
 - [Join the Patreon for Uplink](https://patreon.com/paul_maf_and_andrew), and
 - [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/beakerbrowser)

Thanks for reading!
