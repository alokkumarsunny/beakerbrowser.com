## dat:// readonly browsing

<img src="/img/posts/beaker-1-0-beta-4/dat-browsing.png">

When Beaker updated from the Dat protocol to the new [Hypercore Protocol](https://hypercore-protocol.org), we lost the ability to visit `dat://` sites. We got a lot of feedback that this made upgrading to the new protocol difficult, so we implemented a readonly browsing mode for `dat://` to make the process easier.

## Folder sync

Another Beaker feature that was lost with the 1.0 beta was a simple way to auto-sync with a folder outside of Beaker. This release brings back that feature. [Read more about it here](https://docs.beakerbrowser.com/intermediate/syncing-with-folders).

## 'json' encoding

Reading and writing JSON is such a common pattern that we decided to make it easier. Now you can specify a `'json'` encoding when you read or write a file to have the API accept or emit objects.

```javascript
await myDrive.writeFile('/foo.json', {hello: 'world'}, 'json')
var obj = await myDrive.readFile('/foo.json', 'json')
```

## New `forkDrive` params

"Forking" is a way to quickly duplicate a hyperdrive, and it comes in two modes: "attached" (where the new drive is linked to the original as a fork) or "detached" (where the new drive is an independent copy). We decided to update the API so that you can create detached forks. You can also specify a title and description, and skip the "create" modal.

```js
await beaker.hyperdrive.forkDrive(url, {
  title: 'My copy',
  description: 'A copy of the original',
  detached: true,
  prompt: false
})
```
